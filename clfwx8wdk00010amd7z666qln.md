## What is Kernel?

Ans:- The kernel is like the ***Brain*** of an operating system. It controls and manages all the important things that happen on a computer, such as *managing memory, running programs, communicating with hardware devices, and handling input/output operations*. Without the kernel, the operating system and the computer would not be able to function properly.

## What is Shell?

Ans:- In computing, a shell is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with an operating system by entering commands. A shell provides a way for users to execute commands, run programs, and access system resources.

There are many different shells available for various operating systems, such as ***Bash (Bourne-Again SHell), Zsh (Z Shell), Ksh (Korn shell), and PowerShell (for Windows)***. Each shell has its own set of features, syntax, and commands.

## What is Linux Shell Scripting?

Ans:- Linux shell scripting is the process of writing scripts in the Linux shell to automate tasks and manage system resources.

The Linux shell is a command-line interface that provides users with access to the operating system's services and resources.

A shell script is a program that is written in the shell's scripting language and executed by the shell interpreter & a shell is a powerful tool that allows users to perform complex tasks by executing commands and scripts.

### **What is Shell Scripting for DevOps?**

Ans:- *Shell scripting* is a powerful tool for ***DevOps engineers*** that allows them to ***automate tasks, manage infrastructure, reduce errors and deploy software more efficiently***. DevOps is a methodology that ***emphasizes collaboration and communication between development and operations teams to deliver software faster and more reliably.***

### What is `#!/bin/bash?` can we write `#!/bin/sh` as well?

Ans:- `#!/bin/bash` is known as the "***shebang***" and it is a special syntax that tells the ***OS*** which interpreter to use to run the script. In this case, `#!/bin/bash` tells the system to use the `Bash shell` interpreter to run the script.

Yes, it is also possible to write `#!/bin/sh` instead of `#!/bin/bash`.

`#!/bin/bash` Bash is a popular shell that is widely used in Linux and Unix systems.

`#!/bin/sh` is used to specify that the ***Bourne shell*** should be used to interpret the script. The ***Bourne shell*** is an older shell that is still available on most Unix-like systems. It is a simpler shell compared to Bash and ***lacks some of the advanced features that are available in Bash.***

### Write a Shell Script that prints `I will complete #90DaysOofDevOps challenge.`

Ans:- `vim` [`devops.sh`](http://devops.sh)

`#!/bin/bash`

`echo "I will complete #90DaysOfDevOps Challenge"`

`chmod 700` [`devops.sh`](http://devops.sh)

`./`[`devops.sh`](http://devops.sh)

Output

`I will complete #90DaysOfDevOps Challenge`

### Write a Shell Script to take user input, input from arguments and print the variables.?

Ans:- `vim` [`dayq7.sh`](http://dayq7.sh)

`chmod 700` [`dayq7.sh`](http://dayq7.sh)

`cat` [`dayq7.sh`](http://dayq7.sh)

`ek dam mast`

`Hn Bhai ek dam mast`
