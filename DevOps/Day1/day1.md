Getting started with DevOps
Day#1 of 90DaysOfDevOps

Introduction To DevOps
DevOps Introduction
First Thing That Comes to Our Mind That What is DevOps?🤔😃
Then Why Are We Learning This?🤔
So Let's Start The Journey To Learn Devops🚀

DevOps
(Dev+Ops) Which State that It is a combination of two words development and Operation For Example :)

Whenever an application is made like ChatGPT, Google, FaceBook, etc. So those Who Make this application are Called developers And Who Deploy the code of that application? which checks whether it has passed all the test cases, which is easily available to the user done by Operation Team This Entire Process is called DevOps.

Definition
DevOps is a methodology and process. or The Collaboration Between Development and Operation teams to deploy monitors and scale production apps is called DevOps.

Why are we learning this?🤔
The Ans Is for 👇

Greater Scalability

Deploy faster-50%

Better Recovery time

Improved Security

Early error detection

Production support

What are Automation, Scaling and Infrastructure ?

Automation involves using tools and processes to automate repetitive tasks, such as building and testing code. This can save time and reduce errors, making it easier to deliver software quickly and reliably. For example, a DevOps team might use tools like Jenkins or Travis CI to automate the build and test processes for their code.

Scaling involves the ability to quickly and easily scale up or down resources, such as servers, to meet demand. This is important for organizations that need to handle spikes in traffic or usage. For example, a company that runs a popular e-commerce site might need to quickly scale up its server capacity during holiday shopping periods.

Infrastructure refers to the underlying systems and technologies that support software applications. This includes servers, databases, and other hardware and software components. In DevOps, infrastructure is typically managed using code, which allows teams to easily provision and manage resources as needed. For example, a DevOps team might use tools like Terraform or Ansible to manage their infrastructure as code.

Together, automation, scaling, and infrastructure help DevOps teams deliver software quickly, reliably, and at scale. By automating tasks, scaling resources as needed, and managing infrastructure as code, organizations can improve efficiency, reduce errors, and respond more quickly to changing market conditions.

Terms in DevOps
Provisioning — The server is ready with OS, software and networking.

Deployment — Adding or upgrading software on the server.

Orchestration — coordinated operations on multiple systems.

Configuration management — managing server configuration via files such as ram, space, dependency software etc.

Imperative (procedural) — commands to produce the desired state

Declarative (procedural) *— the desired state is defined and tools will achieve it

Idempotent *— repeat execution and same result.

Blue Green Deployment — Identical deployment, used as a switch.

Continuous Integration — Build and unit test at every check-in.

Continuous Delivery — deploy on production live environment at every check-in.

Continuous Deployment — After unit testing, deploy changes to production in small batches.
