clear to clear entire Screen in Your Terminal.

pwd it shows the present working Directory ,to check in which folder/path you are in.

mkdir (make a Directory) to make a folder.

touch xyz.txt touch touch command is used to create a file

touch python react js to create multiple files.

touch books{1..N} to create 1 to N num of files

mkdir xyz{1..N} to create multiples dir

mkdir -p xyz/abc/def to make dir inside a dir / make a nested directory

echo "hello world" -> Hello World to print something.

echo "hello world" > hello.txt to print/add something in file.

cat hello.txt -> hello world to see what contents are there in that file.

cd mean change Directory

cd .. to go previous path

cd xyz to go inside that xyz folder

cd / to go inside root user

history shows what command you have written till now in that terminal.

uname It shows the Kernel(Os) name.

uname -r it shows the version of Kernel.

date it show the date

To move a file to a folder/ one place to another places . suppose their are 1 folder and 2 files (devops and hello.txt, helo.txt) we want helo.txt should go to the devops folder.

mv helo.txt devops/ and your file is in that devops folder

ls -a This will list all the files and directories in the current directory, including the hidden ones, with their respective permissions, owner, size, and modification time.
