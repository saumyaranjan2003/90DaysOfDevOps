To find the difference between fruits.txt and Colors.txt files. ?
Ans:- To find the difference between two files in Linux, you can use the diff command. The diff command compares two files line by line and shows the differences between them.
diff fruits.txt Colors.txt

This output shows that the first line of fruits.txt (Apple) is different from the first line of Colors.txt (Red). Similarly, lines 3, 5, and 7 have differences as well. The < symbol indicates the line from the first file (fruits.txt), while the > symbol indicates the line from the second file (Colors.txt). The c and a character indicate whether a line was changed (c) or added (a).
